/*
App.css =>
This is a stylesheet that typically contains styles specific to the App component. It's 
usually used for styling the App.js (or App.jsx) component and 
its child components.

While index.css is used for global styles, App.css is a good place to put styles that are 
only relevant to the root component of your app (App.js or App.jsx) and its immediate 
child components.
