//controllers
//Purpose: This folder typically contains logic for handling incoming requests and responses.
//Role: Controllers act as intermediaries between the routes and the models. They 
     // process incoming data (from routes), call models for data manipulation, and send 
     // appropriate responses back to the client.
//Example: If thereâ€™s an API for user registration, 
// the userController.js might contain a function to handle user creation.
